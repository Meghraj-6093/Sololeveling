      <h2>Sung Jin-Woo</h2>
      <p>
        Sung Jin-Woo starts as the weakest E-Rank hunter known as the "World's Weakest." After a deadly double dungeon incident, he gains the power of the System, allowing him to level up infinitely. As he progresses, he becomes the Shadow Monarch, capable of commanding an army of shadows, and grows to become the strongest hunter on Earth, eventually facing off against Monarchs and Rulers in an epic war.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jin-Woo's journey is full of battles, growth, and sacrifice. He develops a close bond with his shadows, protects his family, and ultimately resets time to save everyone. His character evolves from a scared hunter to the savior of the world.
